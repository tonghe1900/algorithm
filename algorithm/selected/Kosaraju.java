 *
 * An implementation of Kosaraju's algorithm for finding strongly-connected
 * components (SCCs) of a graph in linear time.  While Kosaraju's algorithm is
 * not the fastest known algorithm for computing SCCs (both Tarjan's algorithm
 * and Gabow's algorithm are faster by roughly a factor of two), it is a
 * remarkably elegant algorithm with asymptotic behavior identical to the other
 * algorithms.
 *
 * Kosaraju's algorithm relies on several important properties of graphs.
 * First, any graph can be decomposed into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
 * SCCs.  This yields an interesting observation.  Suppose that we start in a
 * node in an SCC that's a sink node in this DAG and perform a depth-first
 * search.  Because the SCC is a sink in the DAG, there are no outgoing edges
 * from it, and so every node we encounter we must be in the same SCC.  If we
 * then remove all of these nodes and repeat, we can repeatedly find sink SCCs,
 * run depth-first searches in them, and then recover all the nodes in the SCC.
 *
 * The challenge is how we can find which SCCs are sinks in the DAG.  For this,
 * Kosaraju's algorithm uses a clever trick.  Suppose that we run a full depth-
 * first search on the nodes in the graph, recording each node on a stack when
 * we finish expanding it.  Then we know that the topmost node of this stack
 * must be in a source SCC, since if it weren't, then some node in an SCC above
 * it would be have been expanded before it.  More generally, if two nodes u
 * and v are on the stack with u deeper than v, then the SCC containing v is
 * no lower than the SCC containing u.  This means that if we run this DFS in
 * the graph and then explore the nodes in the order in which they come back
 * off the stack, we'll explore the DAG's sources one after the other.
 *
 * Of course, this is backwards - we want to explore the sinks, not the
 * sources!  But this isn't a problem.  If we consider the reverse graph of
 * the original graph (formed by directing each arc the opposite of its normal
 * direction), then we don't change the SCCs.  You can see this by realizing
 * that two nodes in an SCC have two paths between them - one forward and one
 * backward - and so in the reverse graph both of these paths will still exist,
 * albeit swapped with one another.  However, reversing the edges does change
 * the DAG of SCCs in the graph by inverting all of the arcs in it.  This means
 * that in the reverse graph source SCCs become sink SCCs and vice-versa.
 * The net result of this is that if we run a full DFS in the reverse graph,
 * then run a depth-first search from each node in the graph in the reverse
 * order in which they are visited, we will end up recovering all the SCCs.
