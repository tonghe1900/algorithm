 *
 * An implementation of Johnson's all-pairs shortest paths algorithm.  This
 * algorithm is remarkable in that it combines two single-source shortest path
 * algrithms - Dijkstra's algorithm and the Bellman-Ford algorithm - into a
 * single algorithm for all-pairs shortest paths that ends up being more
 * efficient than the Floyd-Warshall all-pairs shorest paths algorithm when
 * run on sparse graphs.
 *
 * The idea behind the algorithm is as follows.  If a graph contains no
 * negative edges, then we can compute all-pairs shortest paths in
 * O(mn + n^2 log n) by calling Dijkstra's algorithm (O(m + n lg n)) once for
 * each of the n nodes in the graph.  However, in general, we can't make this
 * assumption about edge weights.  The idea behind Johnson's algorithm is to
 * enforce that all the edge costs in the graph are nonnegative by modifying
 * the costs of the nodes in the graph.  In particular, it computes a
 * potential function h(v) for each node in the graph, and then creates a new
 * edge cost for each edge:
 *
 *                        l'(u, v) = l(u, v) - h(v) + h(u)
 *
 * The key insight is that for any path P in the graph with updated edge
 * costs, we have that
 *
 * l'(P) =     SUM    l'(u, v) =     SUM     (l(u, v) - h(v) + h(u))
 *        (u, v) in P            (u, v) in P
 *
 *       = (    SUM       l(u, v)) - h(v_k) + h(v_0)   (path from v_0 to v_k)
 *          (u, v) in P
 *
 *       = l(P) - h(v_k) + h(v_0)
 *
 * The rationale behind the transition from the first line to the second is
 * that the sum of h(u) - h(v) telescopes, since the h(v) of one term in the
 * sum is the h(u) term in the next.  Consequently, we have that the cost of
 * any path in the new graph is given by the cost of the path in the old graph
 * plus some constant term that depends on the choice of h.  Consequently, any
 * shortest path in the new graph is also a shortest path in the old graph,
 * though it may have higher weight.
 *
 * The key insight behind Johnson's algorithm is how to compute a choice of h
 * such that l'(u, v) is nonnegative for all (u, v) \in E.  For this, the
 * algorithm uses a remarkable trick.  It begins by constructing a new,
 * augmented graph G' formed by taking the input graph G, then adding a new
 * source node s with a length-zero edge to each node in G.  The value of h(v)
 * is then the cost of the shortest path in the graph from s to v.  Since the
 * graph may contain negative edges, we can find these paths most efficiently
 * using the Bellman-Ford algorithm starting from s.  Assuming the input graph
 * has no negative cycles, the new graph does not contain negative cycles
 * either, because all the edges from s are directed into the old graph.
 *
 * The reason that this trick works is that we have that for any nodes u and v
 * with an edge from u to v between them, that
 *
 *                           h(v) <= h(u) + l(u, v)
 *
 * or, equivalently
 *                           h(v) - h(u) <= l(u, v)
 *
 * This holds because one possible shortest path from s to v is to take the
 * shortest path from s to u, then to follow the edge from u to v.  From this,
 * we get that
 *
 *          l'(u, v) = l(u, v) - h(v) + h(u) >= l(u, v) - l(u, v) = 0
 *
 * All the edge weights are now nonnegative, and Dijkstra's algorithm can be
 * used to compute shortest paths.
 *
 * Let's finally consider the runtime of this algorithm.  The new graph G' can
 * be constructed in time O(n + m) by simply cloning the graph and adding some
 * extra edges (O(n) of them) to it.  The resulting graph has O(n) nodes and
 * O(m + n) = O(m) edges.  Running Bellman-Ford here takes time O(mn), and
 * the final run of Dijkstra's algorithm then takes O(mn + n^2 lg n) for a net
 * runtime of O(mn + n^2 lg n).  In the worst case when m = Theta(n^2) this
 * runtime is O(n^3), matching the bound set by Floyd-Warshall, but if m is
 * low (say, O(n lg n)) the runtime is O(n^2 lg n), asymptotically faster than
 * Floyd-Warshall.
 *
 * This code relies on several other pieces of code from the Archive of
 * Interesting Code.  In particular, it needs
